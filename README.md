# Clojure-Kit DevKt

This is the DevKt version of [Clojure-Kit](https://github.com/gregsh/Clojure-Kit).  
It's recommended to use [this plugin](https://github.com/devkt-plugins/la-clojure-devkt) based on [la-clojure](https://github.com/JetBrains/la-clojure) which works better with DevKt.

# Build

```
$ gradlew jar
